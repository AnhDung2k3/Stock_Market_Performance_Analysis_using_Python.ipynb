# Stock_Market_Performance_Analysis_using_Python.ipynb

Hello, this is my first personal project about Data Analytics. 

In this project, I analyze Stock Market Performance of 4 companies in the last 3 months, they are: Apple, META, Google and Microsoft. I use yfinance API to collect real-time stock market data. There are two aspects to analyzing stock prices, they are "Moving Averages" and "Volatility". From all the data that I gained after downloading, I draw some charts to visualize data including line chart, area chart and scatter chart. And based on all the things I've done above, I can help investors decide which companies to invest in that provide the highest returns.
